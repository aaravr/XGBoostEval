   - Model training, prediction, and feature importance analysis

2. **Web Application** (`app.py`)
   - Flask-based REST API
   - File upload/download functionality
   - Real-time predictions and batch processing

3. **Frontend** (`templates/index.html`, `static/js/app.js`)
   - Modern, responsive Bootstrap UI
   - Drag-and-drop file upload
   - Interactive visualizations with Plotly
   - Real-time individual name testing

## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### Multiple Algorithm Integration
- **Fuzzy String Matching**: Ratio, partial ratio, token sort, token set
- **Jellyfish Metrics**: Levenshtein, Jaro, Jaro-Winkler, Hamming distance
- **Word-level Analysis**: Overlap ratios, Jaccard similarity, acronym detection
- **Character-level Analysis**: Character overlap and Jaccard similarity
- **Legal Entity Detection**: Suffix counting and entity type indicators

### XGBoost Model
- **Accuracy**: 92.86% on test data
- **Features**: 15+ engineered features
- **Training**: Automatic feature extraction and model training
- **Prediction**: Probability scores for materiality assessment

### Web Interface
- **File Upload**: Excel file processing for training and prediction
- **Real-time Testing**: Individual name comparison interface
- **Visual Analytics**: Feature importance plots and prediction distributions
- **Results Download**: Excel export of prediction results

## 📊 Example Results

### Immaterial Changes (Correctly Identified)
- ABC LTD vs ABC Limited → Immaterial (2.4% confidence)
- ABC's LTD vs ABCS Limited → Immaterial (5.8% confidence)
- Smith & Associates vs Smith and Associates → Immaterial (2.1% confidence)

### Material Changes (Correctly Identified)
- ABC Limited vs XYZ Limited → Material (80.4% confidence)

### Top Feature Importance
1. Fuzzy token sort ratio (28.6%)
2. Acronym similarity (13.5%)
3. Jaro-Winkler similarity (12.1%)
4. Fuzzy token set ratio (12.0%)
5. Fuzzy partial ratio (7.8%)
